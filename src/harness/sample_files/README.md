This directory contains sample files illustrating the expected format of the test vector inquiries (`request_sample.json`) and test vector response masks (`mask_sample.json`), as well as a sample AFC response (`response_sample.json`), all in JSON format. These files are not intended to be valid responses reflecting actual power limits that should be imposed given the presence of existing incumbent users--they are merely included to illustrate the message/object formats.

`request_sample.json` and `response_sample.json` can be found in the Wi-Fi Alliance AFC System to AFC Device Interface Specification v1.5. `mask_sample.json` is designed to illustrate some of the options available with the harness's response mask format, such as the optionality of the `nominalValue` and `lowerBound` fields of the power limit objects.

Complete documentation of the inquiry, response, and response mask formats, as implemented in this SUT test harness, can be found in `../available_spectrum_inquiry_request.py`, `../available_spectrum_inquiry_response.py`, and `../expected_inquiry_response.py`, respectively. Official documentation of the inquiry and response formats can be found in the [Wi-Fi Alliance AFC System to AFC Device Interface Specification](https://www.wi-fi.org/file/afc-specification-and-test-plans).
